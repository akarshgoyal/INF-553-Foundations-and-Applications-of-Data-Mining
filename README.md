This folder has code for all the programming assignments for INF 553 Foundations And Application of Data Mining at USC for the Fall 2018 semester. The following give a brief description of each of the assignments. Programming assignments were implemented using Scala.

Homework 1:
Homework 1 is a warm up for using spark. In this assignment, I completed three tasks. The goal of these two tasks is to get familiar with Spark and do data analysis using Spark RDD.

Homework 2:
This assignment contains two parts. First, I implemented a Model-based Collaborating Filtering(CF) recommendation system using Spark MLlib. Second, I implemented an Item-based CF system without using a library. The datasets I used are the Yelp datasets. The goal of the assignment is to make me understand how different types of recommendation systems work and more importantly, try to find a way to improve the accuracy of the recommendation system myself.

Homework 3:
In this assignment, I implemented the SON Algorithm to solve every case on top of Apache Spark Framework. I found all the possible combinations of the frequent itemsets for any given input file that follows the format of the Yelp Round 12 Dataset. The goal of this assignment is to apply the frequent itemset algorithms on a large number of data and make implementation more performant and efficient in a distributed environment.

Homework 4:
In this assignment, I implemented K-Means and Bisecting K-Means. The data set is Yelp Review Dataset. The goal of this assignment is to understand how to cluster the given data using the above mentioned clustering methods.

Homework 5:
In this assignment, I used Twitter API of streaming to implement the fixed size sampling method (Reservoir Sampling Algorithm) and use the sampling to track the popular tags on tweets and calculate the average length of tweets. Also, I implemented the Bloom Filtering algorithm to estimate whether the hashtags in coming tweets have shown up before.
